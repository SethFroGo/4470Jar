Info:   Magnets are placed by toggling the type of magnet you want to place via the buttons on the left panel and then left
	clicking in the pane.
	Left clicking a magnet when the delete magnet button is toggled on will delete that magnet, additionally,
	right clicking any magnet even if the delete button is not toggled on will delete it.
	The Cease Magmode button will toggle off any magnet placing button that is toggled on.
	Pressing left mouse on a magnet and dragging will move the magnet, and images will move with it.
	Image movement follows a simple slow in/slow out pattern, where movement is fastest in the middle.
	
	Hiccup: Using the Previous, Next, and Delete buttons while magnets are out will clear the panel of all
	magnets.  However, clicking a thumbnail will not do so while still updating the selected image.
